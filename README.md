Matplotlib Chart Generation

Hello user!

This is a python code that generates different charts and graphics from a dataset. The data can be generated while running the code using the python randint function. This creates an array of random data for the charts. The second option is to read the data from a ‘.txt’ file. This must be in a certain format to be read by the code, this formats are specified in the code’s file. And the last option is to use the math mode. This function generates the data in the code itself, but you can specify the equation it uses to generate the arrays. You can modify this in the code overwriting the line where the function is.

The code creates 6 charts using the matplotlib library. A scatter, histogram, plots, fill between and two pie charts (x data and y data). This is code is meant to be used to produce charts and plots for any uses, so you may modify the section where the charts are generated to better fit your needs.
